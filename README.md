# **RE_VAULT**

A collection of my reverse-engineering projects, custom binary challenges, and low-level experiments.

This repo is where I store everything I build as I learn reverse engineering - C and C++ binaries, obfuscation tests, small VMs, and future malware-analysis practice programs.

# **Current Projects**

## **Black Cipher – Flag Hunt Series**

A custom reverse-engineering challenge written in C, featuring:

* simple custom VM logic
* encrypted data sections
* hashing puzzles
* control-flow tricks

More Black Cipher challenges will be added over time as the series grows.

---

# **What This Repository Contains**

* the Black Cipher challenge series
* C and C++ binary experiments
* basic obfuscation tests
* beginner anti-debug ideas
* VM and bytecode experiments
* future malware-style binaries for safe analysis practice

This repo basically holds anything low-level I build while learning.

---

# **Future Additions**

Planned additions:

* more Black Cipher levels
* basic malware-simulation binaries (for RE practice only)
* more C/C++ challenges
* simple packer/unpacker projects
* cleaner VM designs
* more RE labs as I progress

The goal is for RE_VAULT to grow into a long-term archive of everything I learn in reverse engineering.
