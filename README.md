# RE_VAULT

A collection of reverse-engineering challenges, malware development exercises, and low-level binary experiments. This repository documents my journey into binary analysis, exploit development, and understanding how malicious software works at the assembly level.

## What This Repository Contains

### Reverse Engineering Challenges
Custom-built binaries designed to teach RE fundamentals:
- **Black Cipher** - Multi-stage flag hunt with custom VM, encrypted sections, and control-flow obfuscation
- Additional CTF-style challenges covering various RE concepts
- Progressive difficulty from beginner to intermediate techniques

### Malware Development & Analysis
Educational malware samples for learning offensive and defensive techniques:
- Custom malware written in C/C++ demonstrating real-world techniques
- Complete source code with detailed documentation
- Corresponding Ghidra/IDA analysis walkthroughs
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Safe, controlled environment testing only

### Low-Level Experiments
- C/C++ binary manipulation and obfuscation
- Anti-debugging and anti-analysis techniques
- Custom VM and bytecode interpreters
- Packer/unpacker development
- Shellcode and payload experiments

## Purpose & Ethics

**Educational Use Only**: All malware samples are created for learning reverse engineering and malware analysis techniques. This work supports defensive security skills - understanding how attacks work to better defend against them.

**Safe Practice**: All malicious code is clearly labeled, documented, and designed for isolated lab environments only.

## Skills Demonstrated

- C/C++ low-level programming
- x86/x64 assembly analysis
- Binary reverse engineering (Ghidra, IDA, GDB)
- Malware analysis (static and dynamic)
- Obfuscation and evasion techniques
- Threat intelligence and ATT&CK mapping

## Current Projects

- Black Cipher challenge series
- Educational malware sample collection
- Custom obfuscation techniques
- Anti-analysis method research

## Future Additions

- Advanced RE challenges with increasing complexity
- Malware family analysis (ransomware, trojans, rootkits)
- Exploit development exercises
- Advanced packing/unpacking techniques
- Kernel-mode experiments
- More sophisticated VM designs
