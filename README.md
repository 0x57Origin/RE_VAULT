# **RE_VAULT**

A collection of my reverse-engineering projects, custom binary challenges, and low-level experimentation.

This repository serves as my long-term archive for everything I build in the RE space - binaries, obfuscation experiments, VM designs, and fully custom challenge sets.

## **Current Projects**

### **Black Cipher – Flag Hunt Series**

An advanced reverse-engineering challenge written in C, featuring:

* custom bytecode VM
* hostile control flow
* encrypted data sections
* multi-stage hashing logic
* memory-based artifacts
* protocol decoding puzzles

More challenges in this series will be added over time as the complexity grows.

## **Purpose of This Repository**

RE_VAULT contains:

* reverse-engineering challenges I build
* binary analysis experiments
* obfuscation and anti-debug research
* C-based RE puzzles
* long-term low-level development artifacts

It is an expanding vault of ongoing work.

## **Future Additions**

Planned additions include:

* new Black Cipher modules
* malware-style VM experiments
* advanced obfuscation research binaries
* multi-layer puzzle executables
* interactive RE labs

The repository will grow as I continue developing more complex challenges.
