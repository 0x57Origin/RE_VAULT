# RE_VAULT

RE_VAULT is a personal reverse engineering and malware analysis lab focused on
binary analysis, Linux internals, and understanding real-world offensive techniques
from a defensive and research perspective.

## Contents
- **FLAG_HUNT_BLACK_CIPHER/**  
  A single CTF-style reverse engineering challenge built in C.  
  This is the only CTF project in the repository and will remain standalone.

- **Phantom-Persistence/**  
  Linux malware research project demonstrating persistence concepts,
  implant structure, and basic C2 communication for analysis purposes.

## Focus Areas
- Reverse engineering C binaries
- Static and dynamic analysis
- Malware behavior research
- Persistence mechanisms
- Obfuscation and anti-analysis concepts

## Planned Additions
- Linux malware samples for analysis
- Packers and unpacking exercises
- Obfuscated binaries
- Reverse engineering notes and tooling experiments

This repository is a learning vault, not a toolkit.

**Disclaimer**: This repository is for educational and research purposes only. All content is designed to improve defensive security capabilities through understanding offensive techniques.
